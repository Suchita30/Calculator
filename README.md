# Calculator
Advanced Calculator
A web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides basic and advanced arithmetic functionality. This project includes features like keyboard support, error handling, and additional tools such as square root calculation and memory recall.
________________________________________
Features
•	Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
•	Advanced Features:
o	Square root calculation (√).
o	Percentage calculation (%).
o	Memory recall (MR) for storing and retrieving values.
•	User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive layout with clear buttons and a responsive display.
•	Keyboard Support: Operate the calculator using your keyboard.
•	Error Handling: Displays errors for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero, square root of a negative number).
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	User Input:
o	Click on the buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), or special functions (C, %, √, MR).
o	Alternatively, use your keyboard for input.
2.	Perform Calculations:
o	Input numbers and operators sequentially.
o	Press = or Enter to calculate the result.
3.	Clear Display:
o	Use the C button or Escape key to reset the display.
4.	Square Root:
o	Click √ to calculate the square root of the current number.
5.	Percentage:
o	Use % for modular arithmetic or percentage calculations.
6.	Memory Recall:
o	The MR button retrieves the stored memory value for reuse.

Keyboard Controls
Key	Action
0-9, +, -, *, /, .	Enter digits and operators
Enter or =	Perform calculation
Escape	Clear the display
Backspace	Delete the last input
Shift + 5	Percentage (%)
________________________________________
Error Handling
•	Division by Zero: Displays an "Error" message for invalid operations like dividing by zero.
•	Invalid Inputs: Handles cases like consecutive operators or incomplete expressions gracefully.
•	Mathematical Errors: Prevents operations like the square root of a negative number.
